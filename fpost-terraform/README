Question 1 (Level 1):
Please write automation for infrastructure creation in Azure Cloud for:
1. Azure Resource Group
- name – sre-challenge-flashenpost
- tag – department: SRE

2. Azure Storage account
- name – srechallengeforflaschenpost
- resource-group - sre-challenge-flashenpost
- SKU – Standard_LRS
- Access tier HOT
- tag – department: SRE

3. Storage Account Container

- storage account name – srechallengeforflaschenpost
4. Please add outputs to expose

Assume:
• It is enough to save the output of the terraform plan , without actual creation of the
infrastructure
• You use Terrafrom v1+
• You commit state file locally
• You use Azure West Europe Region

==============

- Here I configured a terraform module for the resources, we can store these TF modules in a separate git repository in real working environment.
- Terraform and provider plugins are versioned appropriately
- I have configured and isolated TF configuration for each environment ( Dev to production)
- we can also use TF workspace method which will result into managing less TF configuration file
- Added a sample gitlab pipeline with TF steps such as init,plan,drift,apply assuming we use gitlab for TF deployment
